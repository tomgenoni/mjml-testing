# mjml-testing

A minimal example of mlml compiling with:

1. Custom components built on mjml's core components
2. Thumbprint tokens for colors, font sizes, etc.
3. Handlebars for data

## Run locally

```
yarn && yarn start
```

This will output `index.html` to the root. You can drag into a web browser to render and inspect.
